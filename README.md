# GA_DSI_projects
#### Data Science completed in General Assembly DSI

### At a glance
GA DSI is a 3 months intensive project where students get to learn and practise data science concepts through varios projects. In this repository, I have included some of the projects I have completed which demonstrates different data scinece relate skills such as data gathering, loading, EDA and models building.

### Project 1: SAT score in 2001
This projects focuses on the use of CSV files without the help of Pandas. It is also a very important demonstration of how EDA visualisations can help data scientists spotting outliers

### Project 2: Billboard 100 in 2000
This project demonstrates the power of Pandas and how it can group, slice and aggregate data. Like the previous project it also shows the importance of EDA in finding out abnoraml patterns which could be a hint that humna manipulation was involved. Hypothesis tests were also carried out in order to see whether there are difference between the population and a subgroup.

### Project 3: Alcohol in Iowa
This project was based on a scenario that a liquor dealer wished to open a new store in Iowa. The focus now shifts to model building. By analysing the data and creating regression models for each location (City, zip code etc.), I assisted the company to find areas with good potential for its new store.

### Project 4: Data Scientist Salary
The aim of the project is to estimate data scientist salary in major cities of the United States. The focus of the project is on web scraping techniques using Beautifulsoup and Regular Expressions. Also, classification was used instead of regression due to the naturally high variance nature of job salaries (great lesson in reframing the problem to obtain useful insights). Logistic Regression was used as the model in this scenario

### Project 5: Titanic
This is the famous Titanic data set from Kaggle. The aim of this project is to familiarise myself in connecting to remote databases (AWS S3) and dig deeper into more classification models. It is also a good practise on feature engineering due to the vast amount of information available in the Kaggle forum. The ideas of Grid Search and ensembling were also experimented. Evaluation tools such as confusin matrices, classification report and ROC curves were produced and discussed.

### Project 6: Netflix Scores
This project predicts whether a movie would be rated highly in the IMDB. The nature of the analysis is similar to project 4 however it includes the use of API enquiries in data gathering. Feature selection was also perfomred in this project to try optimising the performance of the model.

### Capstone Project: Building Bricks of Building Bricks - A tour of the Lego world in a data perspective
This capstone project wraps up the learning in the whole course. Data was gathered from different sources and merged for the analysis. There are 3 goals for this project:
- predict Lego MSRP
- predict Lego popularity
- Classify Lego sets that would beat the FTSE 100 benchmark in 2015-2016
Most of the skills used in previous projects were used in this analysis. Some other techniques were also used such as clustering analysis, utilisation of AWS EC2 instances and voting ensemble of different classifiers.
